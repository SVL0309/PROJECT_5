## PROJECT_5

**Objective**:
The goal of the project at Vanguard is to analyze the results of a digital experiment conducted from 3/15/2017 to 6/20/2017. The experiment compares the effectiveness of Vanguard's traditional online process (Control Group) with a new, modern User Interface (UI) and in-context prompts (Test Group) to determine if the changes lead to higher process completion rates and a better user experience.

**Dataset**:
There are three datasets that will guide our journey:

Client Profiles (df_final_demo): Demographics like age, gender, and account details of our clients.
Digital Footprints (df_final_web_data): A detailed trace of client interactions online, divided into two parts: pt_1 and pt_2. It’s recommended to merge these two files prior to a comprehensive data analysis.
Experiment Roster (df_final_experiment_clients): A list revealing which clients were part of the grand experiment.
